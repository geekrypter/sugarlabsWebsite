## SugarLabs.org Website Sources

This website is created using Jekyll, Bootstrap, some plugins and pure jQuery.

Suggestions are welcome!

Install Ruby and the Gem package manager (pre-installed in Mac OS X) and install `jekyll` and its related packages available in the Github hosted version by running, from this directory:

    bundle install;

Jekyll can run a local web server that rebuilds each time you save a page while editing:

    jekyll serve --incremental;

Then open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
